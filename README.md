# My Langauge Tutor

## Summary of Funcionality

An AI-powered language tutor that allows users endless, dynamic language practice in a variety of languages. 

Users can speak in objective-based scenarios and conversations
with OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

Users can study language lessons (by proficiency level),
save words and phrases, and practice their speaking, listening, and pronunciation skills.

Clicking phrases calls Azure's text-to-speech endpoint and returns sythesized audio for pronunciation practice.

Completely designed and built by Austin Wisdom.

## Phase 1:

Phase 1 was completed for my BrainStation capstone project, presented on June 28th, 2023

## Phase 2:

To be completed:

> Finish implementing speech-to-text funcionality to allow users to speak more.

> Build in Google login authentication to allow multiple users to securely access the site.

> Add more tables to the database to track user data and progress.

> Add more conversation scenarios for additional languages.

> Add more lessons and word practice page for flashcard-style vocabulary practice.


# Final Considerations

You will need your own OpenAI API key and Azure API key (and region) in order to fully utilize the app.
